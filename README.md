## 🚀 Running the Code

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
This will install dependencies and start the development server.

🧩 Overview
QAI-UFT extends the Quantum AI Neural Network concept with:

Harmonic-field mapping modules based on Unified Field Theory analogies

Trinary and sexagesimal encoders for acoustic-frequency data

Visualization hooks for Figma exports and ritual-architecture layouts

Microtonal tuning utilities for sound synthesis and psychoacoustic modeling

The framework bridges scientific visualization, creative computation, and resonant field design — forming the software backbone of the QSOL Unified Field Framework: Resonance as Embodied Physics.
